    Renders the "About" section in the Streamlit sidebar with expandable information panels.

    This function adds an informational sidebar section to the app, containing
    details about the application's purpose, prediction methodology, model details,
    key features, and author credits. Each section is collapsible for improved readability.

    Sections Included
    -----------------
    1. What is this app?
    2. How does it predict?
    3. Model Details
    4. Outputs & Features
    5. Feedback & Credits

    Behavior
    --------
    - Uses expandable sections (`st.expander`) to display information neatly.
    - Displays section titles with relevant emojis for visual clarity.
    - Handles exceptions gracefully and displays an error message if rendering fails.
